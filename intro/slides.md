# Front-End Web Development
## Let's Break It Down



#### About General Assembly
<aside class="notes">Kalina 2 Min: What is General Assembly</aside>


#### General Assembly's Core Values
<aside class="notes">Kalina 3 Min: How does General Assembly operate</aside>



## PEOPLE BEFORE THE MACHINE

> While we value powerful ideas and innovative start-ups, the lifeblood of any community is the individuals involved. We believe in empathy and reciprocity — and that community can enable individual pursuits. 



## LEARNING BY DOING
<aside class="notes">Allison</aside>

> We believe that self-actualization is gained through applied, hands- on experience. We are here not to seek or to hope for the future, but actively construct it with our hands. If we get it wrong, we modify and try again; real progress only comes through reflection and relentless iteration. 



## JOURNEY OVER DESTINATION
<aside class="notes">Allison</aside>

> General Assembly is about the shared experience of fellow builders taking risks — about embracing failure as much as success. When great companies fail, they’re gone forever. When great people fail, they learn from their experiences and go on to pursue new ventures with a greater chance of success.
